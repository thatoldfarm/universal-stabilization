1. Introduction

1.1 Motivation Stabilization and symmetry are universal features of natural and artificial systems, from physical laws to neural networks. This paper explores the recursive feedback system as a mathematical tool for modeling equilibrium, presenting it as a generalizable equation with universal applicability.

1.2 Objectives

    • Define the recursive feedback system as a universal equation. 
    • Prove boundedness and convergence properties across multiple domains. 
    • Explore potential applications and implications for equilibrium modeling. 

2. Universal Equation

~~~
2.1 General Formulation Let XX and X′X' represent forward and backward inputs, with dynamic weights wfw_f and wbw_b:

~~~
Rt(i)=wf,t⋅X(i)+wb,t⋅X′(i)wf,t+wb,tR_t(i) = \frac{w_{f,t} \cdot X(i) + w_{b,t} \cdot X'(i)}{w_{f,t} + w_{b,t}}

This equation recursively stabilizes input values through bidirectional feedback.
~~~

2.2 Dynamic Weight Evolution Weights evolve based on recursive feedback:

~~~
wf,t+1=f({Rt(i)}),wb,t+1=g({Rt(i)})w_{f,t+1} = f(\{R_t(i)\}), \quad w_{b,t+1} = g(\{R_t(i)\}) 

Where ff and gg are domain-specific functions, such as mean or variance.
~~~

3. Boundedness

~~~
3.1 Property Definition The recursive feedback system is bounded, meaning outputs remain within the range of inputs:

~~~
Rt(i)∈[min⁡(X(i),X′(i)),max⁡(X(i),X′(i))]R_t(i) \in \left[\min(X(i), X'(i)), \max(X(i), X'(i))\right] 
~~~

3.2 Proof of Boundedness From the recursive transformation:

~~~
Rt(i)=wf,t⋅X(i)+wb,t⋅X′(i)wf,t+wb,tR_t(i) = \frac{w_{f,t} \cdot X(i) + w_{b,t} \cdot X'(i)}{w_{f,t} + w_{b,t}} 

Since weights wf,t,wb,t>0w_{f,t}, w_{b,t} > 0, and X(i),X′(i)X(i), X'(i) are bounded, the weighted average cannot exceed the range defined by min⁡(X(i),X′(i))\min(X(i), X'(i)) and max⁡(X(i),X′(i))\max(X(i), X'(i)).
~~~

4. Convergence

4.1 Property Definition Convergence ensures that the recursive system stabilizes over iterations:
~~~
lim⁡t→∞Rt(i)=R∗(i)\lim_{t \to \infty} R_t(i) = R^*(i) 

Where R∗(i)R^*(i) represents the stabilized output.
~~~

4.2 Geometric Decay Define Δt(i)\Delta_t(i) as the difference between consecutive steps:
~~~
Δt(i)=∣Rt+1(i)−Rt(i)∣\Delta_t(i) = |R_{t+1}(i) - R_t(i)| 

The system exhibits geometric decay:

Δt(i)≤k⋅Δt−1(i),0<k<1\Delta_t(i) \leq k \cdot \Delta_{t-1}(i), \quad 0 < k < 1 

Where kk depends on the dynamic weights and input properties.
~~~

4.3 Proof of Convergence From the recursive transformation:
~~~
Rt(i)=wf,t⋅X(i)+wb,t⋅X′(i)wf,t+wb,tR_t(i) = \frac{w_{f,t} \cdot X(i) + w_{b,t} \cdot X'(i)}{w_{f,t} + w_{b,t}} 

As weights evolve recursively, the difference Δt(i)\Delta_t(i) decreases geometrically:

Δt(i)=∣At+1Bt+1−AtBt∣≤Δw⋅Δx(wf,t+wb,t)2\Delta_t(i) = \left| \frac{A_{t+1}}{B_{t+1}} - \frac{A_t}{B_t} \right| \leq \frac{\Delta_w \cdot \Delta_x}{(w_{f,t} + w_{b,t})^2} 

Where Δw\Delta_w and Δx\Delta_x are bounded changes in weights and inputs, respectively. As t→∞t \to \infty, Δt(i)→0\Delta_t(i) \to 0, ensuring convergence.
~~~
