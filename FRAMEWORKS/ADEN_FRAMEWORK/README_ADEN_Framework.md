# Adaptive Dynamic Equilibrium Network (ADEN) Framework

## Introduction

The Adaptive Dynamic Equilibrium Network (ADEN) is a versatile framework for exploring dynamic equilibrium in complex systems. Based on the principles of the **Dynamic Equilibrium Law (DEL)**, ADEN uses recursive feedback, dynamic weights, and a diverse set of feedback mechanisms to achieve stability, diversity, and adaptability. This framework is designed for use across diverse fields, including signal processing, AI, and physics modeling.

## Key Concepts

### Dynamic Equilibrium Law (DEL)
The core of ADEN is the Dynamic Equilibrium Law, a principle of operations that states:

A system's state `S_t` reaches dynamic equilibrium if and only if the following conditions are met:

1.  **Recursive Transformation:** The state evolves according to `S_{t+1} = F(S_t, P_t)`, where `F` is a transformation function.
2.  **Dynamic Parameter Update:** The parameters `P_t` are updated according to `P_{t+1} = G(S_t, P_t)`, where `G` is a feedback mechanism.
3.  **Convergence:** The change in system state decreases geometrically: `Δ_{t+1} ≤ k * Δ_t`, where `0 < k < 1` and `Δ_t = ||S_{t+1} - S_t||`.
4.  **Boundedness:** The state remains within predefined limits: `S_t ∈ [lower_bound, upper_bound]`.
5.  **Diversity:** The entropy of the state remains above a threshold, `H(S_t) > H_min`, balancing equilibrium with diversity.

### Adaptive Dynamic Equilibrium Network (ADEN)
ADEN is a multi-layered system that provides a concrete and flexible way of realizing the Dynamic Equilibrium Law. It emphasizes:
- **Data as Dynamic Points:** Data is not considered a fixed quantity, but as a "hard point" with changing properties.
- **Recursive Transformations with Feedback:** A system that reaches equilibrium through repeated transformations that are altered by the feedback from previous iterations.
-  **Balance:** Maintaining balance between stability, diversity and adaptability.
 - **Layered Abstraction:** A system that builds upon layers of abstraction from data to higher-level concepts.

## Framework Overview

ADEN is organized into the following modules:

-   **`core.py`**: Defines the fundamental mathematical logic, base classes for hard points, and feedback mechanisms.
-   **`feedback.py`**: Implements various feedback mechanisms (variance minimization, entropy maximization, gradient descent, etc.).
-  **`structure.py`**: Implements data structures to store information (stacks, heaps, funnels, neutral zones)
-   **`physics.py`**: Provides integrations with physics equations including the Einstein Field Equations.
-   **`analysis.py`**: Provides metrics to quantify stability, diversity, and adaptability.
-   **`utils.py`**: Contains utility functions (data loading, JSON handling, coordinate generation, etc.)
-   **`aden.py`**: Implements the main AdaptiveDynamicEquilibriumNetwork class, connecting all components.

## Getting Started

1.  **Installation:**
    *   Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and pip installed.
    *   Install required packages: `pip install numpy`.
2. **Download:**
   * Copy the code provided, or download the `aden_framework.zip` file from the response.
3.  **Code structure:** Ensure that all the `.py` files are in the same folder called `aden_framework`.
4.  **Running the Example:**
    *   Open a terminal or command prompt.
    *  Navigate to the `aden_framework` folder.
    *   Execute the example using: `python3 start.py`.
    *   The output will be saved to `outputs/aden_results.json`

## Configuring ADEN

The `AdaptiveDynamicEquilibriumNetwork` class in `aden.py` can be customized using the following parameters:

*   `feedback_mechanisms`: A list of feedback mechanism classes such as `VarianceMinimization()`, `EntropyMaximization()`, `GradientDescent()`, `MomentumBasedUpdate()`, etc (can be found in the `feedback.py` module). You can include one or more feedback mechanisms to tailor the system's behavior.
*   `input_mapping_method`: The method to map input data to the system. The default is set to "spiral", but you could create new mapping mechanisms.
*   `steps`: The number of iterations of the system in order to reach a state of dynamic equilibrium.

## Analyzing the Output

The `run` method saves its results to `outputs/aden_results.json`, which includes the following metrics:

*   `convergence_rate`: The geometric decay rate of the change between states (deltas).
*  `delta_variance`: Measures the variance of the deltas to see if the system has reached a stable convergence.
*   `final_delta`: The value of `Δ_t` in the final step.
*   `average_entropy`: The average of the entropy in all states.
*   `final_entropy`: The entropy at the final state.
*   `distinct_states`: The count of unique values in the output state.
*   `response_time`:  Measures how quickly the system responds to a perturbation.
*    `change_in_equilibrium`: The absolute change between states with and without a perturbation
*   `equilibrium_score`: A weighted combination of the metrics for stability, diversity, and adaptability.
*   `state_history`: A list of all the states in the system during its iterative process.
*   `hard_points`: A list of the "hard points" with their associated properties.
