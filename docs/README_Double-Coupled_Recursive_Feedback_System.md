# Double-Coupled Recursive Feedback System

The Double-Coupled Recursive Feedback System introduces a novel, symmetrical approach to recursive stabilization, building upon the foundation of the original recursive feedback equation. This framework balances forward and backward inputs while introducing a mirrored recursive structure to capture deeper interactions and complex dynamics.

## Core Concept
The system models recursive stabilization using forward inputs \(X(i)\) and backward inputs \(X'(i)\), weighted dynamically by \(w_{f,t}\) and \(w_{b,t}\), respectively. The new system embeds the original recursive feedback equation within itself, creating a double-coupled structure.

### Core Equation
The core equation of the Double-Coupled Recursive Feedback System is:

\[
R_t(i) = \frac{w_{f,t} + w_{b,t}}{\frac{w_{f,t} \cdot X(i) + w_{b,t} \cdot X'(i)}{w_{f,t} + w_{b,t}}}
\]

#### Components:
1. **\(R_t(i)\)**: Stabilized output for the \(i\)-th input at time step \(t\).
2. **\(X(i)\)**: Forward input (current state or signal).
3. **\(X'(i)\)**: Backward input (past state, retrocausal signal, or feedback).
4. **\(w_{f,t}\)**: Dynamic weight for forward input, evolving over time.
5. **\(w_{b,t}\)**: Dynamic weight for backward input, evolving over time.

### Weight Evolution
The weights \(w_{f,t}\) and \(w_{b,t}\) adapt dynamically based on the feedback output \(R_t(i)\):

\[
w_{f,t+1} = w_{f,t} + \eta \cdot R_t(i)
\]

\[
w_{b,t+1} = w_{b,t} + \eta \cdot (1 - R_t(i))
\]

Where \(\eta\) is the learning rate controlling the evolution of weights.

## Why It Works
1. **Recursive Symmetry**: By embedding the original equation within itself, the system introduces a second layer of feedback, enhancing stability and adaptability.
2. **Dynamic Stabilization**: The evolving weights ensure the system balances forward and backward inputs under varying conditions.
3. **Emergent Behavior**: The double recursion can produce fractal-like or chaotic patterns, reflecting the complexity of natural systems.

## Advantages
1. **Higher Dimensional Interactions**:
   - The mirrored structure captures richer dynamics, making it suitable for modeling complex systems.
2. **Enhanced Stability**:
   - The outer recursive layer provides additional stabilization, reducing sensitivity to extreme inputs.
3. **Mathematical Elegance**:
   - The symmetrical design aligns with universal principles, such as time symmetry or energy conservation.

## Applications
### 1. **Chaotic Systems**
- Analyze strange attractors and fractal structures in phase-space trajectories.

### 2. **AI and Optimization**
- Enhance neural network training and adaptive optimization through recursive feedback stabilization.

### 3. **Physics and Cosmology**
- Model time-symmetric phenomena, retrocausality, or interactions across temporal dimensions.

        self.w_f = w_f  # Forward weight
        self.w_b = w_b  # Backward weight
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate  # Rate at which weights evolve

    def compute_feedback(self, X, X_prime):

        # Adjust weights based on feedback output
        self.w_f += self.learning_rate * feedback_output
        self.w_b += self.learning_rate * (1 - feedback_output)
        # Ensure weights remain positive
        self.w_f = max(self.w_f, 0.01)
        self.w_b = max(self.w_b, 0.01)

    results = []

    for X, X_prime in zip(X_values, X_prime_values):
        R = feedback_system.compute_feedback(X, X_prime)
        feedback_system.update_weights(R)
        results.append({
