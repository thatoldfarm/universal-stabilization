# Advanced Recursive Feedback System (ARFS) for Pi Digits

## Overview
The Advanced Recursive Feedback System (ARFS) processes large datasets, such as the first million digits of π (pi), to demonstrate the principles of recursive stabilization, symmetry, and convergence. This script applies advanced mathematical techniques including periodic modulation, energy optimization, and entropy maximization, making it suitable for large-scale, multi-dimensional data processing.

## Features

### 1. Recursive Feedback Mechanism
The core formula stabilizes outputs by balancing forward and backward inputs:

\[
R_t(i) = \frac{w_{f,t} \cdot X(i) + w_{b,t} \cdot X'(i)}{w_{f,t} + w_{b,t}}
\]

Where:
- \( R_t(i) \): Stabilized result at step \( t \).
- \( X(i) \): Forward input.
- \( X'(i) \): Backward input.
- \( w_{f,t} \), \( w_{b,t} \): Dynamic forward and backward weights.

---

### 2. Periodic Modulation
Dynamic weights incorporate oscillatory adjustments:

\[
modulation_{factor} = |\sin(\pi \cdot t)| + 1e^{-6}
\]

This modulation ensures the system adapts to periodic behaviors.

---

### 3. Energy Optimization
The system minimizes variance to ensure smooth convergence:

\[
w_{f,t+1} = \frac{1}{1 + \text{Var}(R_t(i))}, \quad w_{b,t+1} = 1 - w_{f,t+1}
\]

Where \( \text{Var}(R_t(i)) \) is the variance of the stabilized outputs.

---

### 4. Entropy Maximization
Entropy is calculated to retain diversity in outputs:

\[
Entropy = -\sum_{i} R_t(i) \cdot \log(R_t(i) + 1e^{-6})
\]

Weights are adjusted proportionally to entropy:

\[
w_{f,t+1} \propto |Entropy|, \quad w_{b,t+1} \propto \frac{1}{|Entropy| + 1e^{-6}}
\]

---

### 5. Inter-Domain Scaling
Weights dynamically scale to adapt to the dimensionality of inputs:

\[
w_{f,t+1} \propto \text{Mean}(\|R_t(i)\|), \quad w_{b,t+1} \propto \frac{1}{\text{Mean}(\|R_t(i)\|) + 1e^{-6}}
\]

## Workflow

### Input Preparation
1. Load up to one million digits of π from a text file.
2. Split the digits into forward and backward sequences:
   - Forward: First 500,000 digits.
   - Backward: Reverse of forward sequence.

### Iterative Processing
1. Perform recursive stabilization over 50 steps.
2. Apply periodic modulation, variance minimization, entropy adjustments, and scaling.
3. Compute convergence deltas at each step to monitor stabilization progress.

### Output
- **Final Result:** Stabilized outputs.
- **Deltas:** Rate of convergence at each step.
- **JSON File:** Results saved in a structured format.

## Example Usage
```python
# Load the first million digits of Pi
file_path = "pi_digits.txt"
pi_digits = load_pi_digits(file_path, max_digits=1000000)

# Run the ARFS
results, deltas = advanced_recursive_feedback(
    forward=pi_digits[:500000],
    backward=pi_digits[:500000][::-1],
    steps=50,
    periodic_modulation=True,
    invariance_transformation=lambda x: x / np.max(x),
    optimize_energy=True,
    entropy_maximization=True,
    inter_domain_scaling=True
)

# Save results to JSON
output_data = {
    "dataset_size": len(pi_digits[:500000]),
    "final_result": results[-1],
    "deltas": deltas
}
with open("large_pi_output.json", "w") as json_file:
    json.dump(output_data, json_file, indent=4)
```

## Results Interpretation
1. **Symmetry and Stability:** Final results highlight balanced convergence between forward and backward sequences.
2. **Entropy and Diversity:** Entropy maximization ensures information-rich outputs.
3. **Scaling Efficiency:** Inter-domain scaling adapts effectively to large datasets.

---

## Applications
- **Big Data Processing:** Efficiently stabilize large, high-dimensional datasets.
- **Signal Processing:** Noise reduction while retaining critical features.
- **Machine Learning:** Preprocessing and stabilization of input data.
- **Scientific Computing:** Analysis of periodic and equilibrium systems.

## Conclusion
The ARFS demonstrates robust performance in processing large-scale datasets, such as the digits of π. Its mathematical rigor and scalability make it a powerful tool for stabilization, symmetry analysis, and equilibrium modeling in diverse domains.
