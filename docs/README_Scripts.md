### README: Recursive Feedback System Scripts

---

#### **Overview**
This suite of Python scripts demonstrates the implementation of Recursive Feedback Systems (RFS), exploring their functionality across scalar, vector, and multi-dimensional data. Each script introduces unique capabilities, from handling higher dimensions to employing a class-based approach for modular and reusable code.

---

### **Scripts Overview**
1. **`rfsbdm.py`** - **Basic Recursive Feedback System**:
   - Implements a straightforward recursive feedback system.
   - Supports scalar and 2D vector data.
   - Dynamically updates forward and backward weights based on data properties.

2. **`rfsbdm_3d.py`** - **Recursive Feedback for Multi-Dimensional Data**:
   - Extends the basic system to support 3D vector data.
   - Visualizes convergence metrics for scalar, 2D, and 3D data.
   - Explores stabilization behavior across dimensions.

3. **`rfsbdm_class.py`** - **Class-Based Recursive Feedback System**:
   - Provides a reusable, modular implementation using object-oriented programming.
   - Supports custom weight update rules, improving flexibility.
   - Includes detailed plotting for system evolution and convergence metrics.

### **Key Features**

#### **1. Recursive Feedback Mechanism**
- Iteratively computes stabilized outputs by balancing forward and backward input sequences.
- Dynamically adjusts weights to reflect evolving data characteristics.

#### **2. Adaptive Weighting**
- Forward (\( w_f \)) and backward (\( w_b \)) weights evolve based on:
  - Mean and maximum values (`rfsbdm.py`, `rfsbdm_3d.py`).
  - Variance-driven adjustments (`rfsbdm_class.py`).

#### **3. Data Compatibility**
- **Scalar Data**: Handles simple numerical sequences, such as digits of \(\pi\).
- **Vector Data**: Supports 2D and 3D arrays for broader applications in physics, graphics, and AI.
- **Custom Sequences**: Class-based implementation allows easy adaptation for diverse datasets.

#### **4. Convergence Analysis**
- Measures stabilization using delta (\( \Delta_t \)), the change between consecutive iterations.
- Visualizes convergence with log-scale plots for better insight into stabilization behavior.

### **Usage**

#### **1. Running the Scripts**
- Ensure dependencies are installed:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib
  ```
- Execute the script:
  ```bash
  python <script_name>.py
  ```

#### **2. Outputs**
- **Console Logs**: Stabilized results and convergence metrics.
- **Plots**:
  - Geometric decay of \(\Delta_t\) to illustrate convergence.
  - Evolution of values over iterations for multi-dimensional data.

#### **3. Customization**
- Modify input sequences to test different datasets:
  - Replace `pi_digits` or `random_vectors` in `rfsbdm.py` and `rfsbdm_3d.py`.
  - Pass new sequences to the `RecursiveFeedbackSystem` class in `rfsbdm_class.py`.

---

### **Applications**
1. **Data Stabilization**:
   - Smooth noisy datasets or resolve conflicts between forward and backward sequences.
2. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**:
   - Explore stabilization in physics simulations, graphics, and signal processing.
3. **Algorithm Development**:
   - Use the class-based script for experimentation with custom weight rules.
