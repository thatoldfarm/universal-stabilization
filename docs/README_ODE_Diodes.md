# ARFS with Dynamic Diodes: Comprehensive Guide

## Overview
This project implements an Adaptive Recursive Feedback System (ARFS) equipped with **dynamic diodes** to control the directional flow of feedback. The ARFS core equation is enhanced to include multiple diode types, enabling advanced stabilization and control mechanisms. This system can be applied across various domains, including artificial intelligence, control systems, and complex dynamic modeling.

## Features
- Implements four types of diodes:
  - **Forward Diode**: Allows only forward feedback flow.
  - **Reverse Diode**: Allows only reverse feedback flow.
  - **Blocking Diode**: Dynamically blocks feedback under specific instability conditions.
  - **Time-Gated Diode**: Alternates between forward and reverse flow based on a time-based switching mechanism.
- Generates time-domain and frequency-domain visualizations for each diode type.
- Outputs simulation results in JSON format for further analysis.

## Core Equation
The ARFS core equation is:

\[
R_t(i) = \frac{w_{f,t} \cdot X(i) + w_{b,t} \cdot X'(i)}{w_{f,t} + w_{b,t}}
\]

Where:
- \( R_t(i) \): Stabilized result for the \(i\)-th input at time step \(t\).
- \( X(i) \): Forward input.
- \( X'(i) \): Backward input.
- \( w_{f,t} \), \( w_{b,t} \): Dynamic weights for forward and backward inputs, evolving over time.

### Modified Equation with Diodes
To incorporate diodes, the equation is updated as follows:

\[
R_t(i) = \frac{D_t(i) \cdot w_{f,t} \cdot X(i) + (-D_t(i)) \cdot w_{b,t} \cdot X'(i)}{|D_t(i)| \cdot (w_{f,t} + w_{b,t})}
\]

Where \(D_t(i)\) is the diode function that controls the directional flow:
- \(D_t(i) = 1\): Forward flow only.
- \(D_t(i) = -1\): Reverse flow only.
- \(D_t(i) = 0\): Blocked feedback.

## Diode Types
1. **Forward Diode**:
   - Always allows forward feedback flow.
   - \[ D_t(i) = 1 \]

2. **Reverse Diode**:
   - Always allows reverse feedback flow.
   - \[ D_t(i) = -1 \]

3. **Blocking Diode**:
   - Dynamically blocks feedback based on a stability metric.
   - Stability Metric:
     \[
     S_t(i) = \frac{|w_{f,t} \cdot X(i) - w_{b,t} \cdot X'(i)|}{w_{f,t} + w_{b,t}}
     \]
   - If \( S_t(i) > \text{threshold} \), then \( D_t(i) = 0 \).

4. **Time-Gated Diode**:
   - Alternates between forward and reverse flow based on time.
   - \[
   D_t(i) = \begin{cases} 
   1 & \text{if } t \mod \tau < \frac{\tau}{2} \\
   -1 & \text{if } t \mod \tau \geq \frac{\tau}{2}
   \end{cases}
   \]

## Logic and Implementation
The ARFS system is implemented as a coupled ODE system:

- State Variable: \(R(t)\), which represents the stabilized system output.
- Auxiliary Variable: \(X(t)\), representing forward feedback dynamics.
- Feedback flow is regulated by the chosen diode type.

Dynamic equations:
\[
X'(t) = -\gamma \cdot X(t) + \sin(t)
\]
\[
R'(t) = \text{ARFS Equation with Diode Control}
\]

## Script Functionality
1. **Simulation**:
   - Simulates the ARFS system for each diode type over a defined time span.
2. **Visualization**:
   - Generates time-domain plots to illustrate the evolution of \(R(t)\) and \(X(t)\).
   - Performs Fourier Transform to analyze \(R(t)\) in the frequency domain.
3. **Output**:
   - Saves results for each diode type in JSON format.
   - Exports PNG visualizations for time-domain and frequency-domain analyses.

## Potential Uses
1. **Artificial Intelligence**:
   - Replace traditional backpropagation in neural networks with a dynamic feedback-based training mechanism.
2. **Control Systems**:
   - Stabilize complex systems with real-time feedback control.
3. **Dynamic Modeling**:
   - Analyze oscillatory behavior in biological, economic, or physical systems.
4. **Signal Processing**:
   - Design adaptive filters and controllers.
