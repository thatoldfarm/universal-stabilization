## 1. Introduction
Modern electronics are built upon layers of abstraction, where software and firmware manage complex stabilization, control, and optimization tasks. While effective, this approach is inherently inefficient due to redundancy and energy overhead. The recursive feedback equation, developed as a universal stabilization mechanism, has demonstrated its ability to address challenges across physics, AI, economics, and more. This paper proposes integrating this equation directly into hardware—at the chip level—to unlock unprecedented levels of efficiency and adaptability.

## 2. Background on Recursive Feedback Systems
The recursive feedback system (RFS) is governed by a universal equation:

\[ R_t(i) = \frac{w_{f,t} \cdot X(i) + w_{b,t} \cdot X'(i)}{w_{f,t} + w_{b,t}} \]

Where:
- **\( R_t(i) \)**: State variable at time \( t \)
- **\( X(i) \)**: Forward input
- **\( X'(i) \)**: Backward input
- **\( w_{f,t} \)**, **\( w_{b,t} \)**: Forward and backward weights

This equation provides stabilization, symmetry, and boundedness across diverse systems. It is highly generalizable, allowing its application to domains as varied as control systems, artificial intelligence, and cryptography.
