# Advanced Recursive Feedback System (ARFS)

## Overview
The Advanced Recursive Feedback System (ARFS) is a Python-based implementation of an enhanced recursive feedback framework. This system introduces cutting-edge features such as periodic modulation, invariance transformations, and inter-domain scaling to achieve dynamic stabilization and balance across a wide range of input data.

## Features

### Core Functionalities
1. **Stabilization:** Balances forward and backward inputs into a unified, converged output.
2. **Periodic Modulation:** Dynamically adjusts weights using oscillatory functions for enhanced adaptability.
3. **Invariance:** Supports input transformations to maintain invariance under scaling and normalization.
4. **Energy Optimization:** Minimizes variance in stabilized results, ensuring smoother convergence.
5. **Entropy Maximization:** Retains diversity and information content during stabilization.
6. **Inter-Domain Scaling:** Adapts seamlessly to higher-dimensional datasets, maintaining stability and performance.

### Applications
- **AI and Machine Learning:** Gradient harmonization, neural network stabilization.
- **Signal Processing:** Noise reduction and adaptive filtering.
- **Economics and Biology:** Modeling cyclic and equilibrium systems.
- **Physics:** Analyzing multi-dimensional systems governed by symmetry.

## Script: `rfsbdm_advanced.py`

### How It Works
The script implements the ARFS with the following workflow:
1. **Input Initialization:** Forward and backward sequences are initialized.
2. **Weight Modulation:** Dynamic adjustments using periodicity and scaling.
3. **Recursive Transformation:** Iterative computation of stabilized outputs.
4. **Energy and Entropy Adjustments:** Balancing optimization and information retention.
5. **Result Convergence:** Outputs stabilize over a defined number of iterations.

### Example Usage
```python
pi_digits = np.array([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3])
negative_pi_digits = pi_digits[::-1]  # Reverse for backward sequence

results, deltas = advanced_recursive_feedback(
    forward=pi_digits,
    backward=negative_pi_digits,
    steps=20,
    periodic_modulation=True,
    invariance_transformation=lambda x: x / np.max(x),  # Normalization
    optimize_energy=True,
    entropy_maximization=True,
    inter_domain_scaling=True
)
```

### Outputs
- **Final Stabilized Result:** Balanced outputs after all iterations.
- **Deltas:** Log-scale values showing the rate of convergence.
- **JSON File:** Results are saved to `output.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
    "final_result": [ ... ],
    "deltas": [ ... ]
}
```

## Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `json`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### Running the Script
Execute the script in your terminal:
```bash
python rfsbdm_advanced.py
```
The output will include plots and a JSON file saved in the same directory.
